def myMethod(String input) {
  if (input == null) { 
    return "Null input"
  }
  return input.toUpperCase()
}

println myMethod(null)
println myMethod("hello")

//The fix is to explicitly handle the null case before calling any methods on the input string.

//In this improved example, the null check is performed before attempting to call the toUpperCase() method.  This ensures that the method is only called when input is a valid String, thereby preventing the NullPointerException. The solution is concise and easy to understand.
